# Introduction

These are my personal notes to prepare for the **LFCS** (Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator) exam.

This repository includes both **theory and practical exercises**, organized according to the **official LFCS domains and competencies** that candidates are expected to master to pass the exam.

Since the LFCS targets **beginner-level system administrators**, I've also included an **Extra section** covering foundational concepts such as **firmware, bootloaders**, and other low-level components.

> ðŸ§  This guide can also serve as a helpful resource when preparing for **Linux System Administrator interviews**.
