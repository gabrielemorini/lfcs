# Introduction
<hr>

These are my personal notes to prepare for the **LFCS** (Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator) exam.

This repository includes both **theory and practical exercises**, organized according to the **official LFCS domains and competencies** that candidates are expected to master to pass the exam. These exercises were created to better understand the responsibilities of a system administrator. Some of them require creating infrastructure diagrams using tools such as app.diagrams or similar.

Since the LFCS targets **beginner-level system administrators**, I've also included an **Extra section** covering foundational concepts such as **firmware, bootloaders**, and other low-level components.

> ðŸ§  This guide can also serve as a helpful resource when preparing for **Linux System Administrator interviews**.
